# Advent Of Code
These are my [Advent Of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com/) solutions, written in Java.

#### Why Java?
Java is the language I'm most familiar with. It's the first language I've ever learned back in 2013, and I know it inside-out by now.

#### Code structure
In the source coude, you'll find under the package `nl.chrisb.aoc` different packages for each year.
In there, you'll find a new Java class for each day with each a seperate `main` method.
It tries to read the input from the `resources` folder, under `{year}/{day}.txt`.
If it can't find that, it will ask for manual input.
