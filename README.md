# Advent Of Code
These are my [Advent Of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com/) solutions, written in Java.

#### Why Java?
Java is the language I'm most familiar with. It's the first language I've ever learned back in 2013, and I know it inside out by now.

#### Code structure
In the source code, you'll find in the package `nl.chrisb.aoc` some other packages for each year.
In those packages, you'll see different Java classes, in the format `D{day}E{part}.java`.
